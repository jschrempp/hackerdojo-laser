###README.md

	This is a page to hold information, scripts, etc. re. the laser printer at Hacker Dojo. It doesn't mean to replace existing infrastructure but it's a place where the software minded of us can go and be comforted by Octocat as we face the 'big scary hardware'.

	The structure is free to change, I don't really have a default way of setting things up, just a system that I use. If there's a paradigm you like, cool.

	Current structure:

	- assets: pictures, images, pdfs, plugins etc. which provide additional information about the laser printer and might be useful in documenting procedure. Basically anything that's not text or script, or things that other people compiled

	- scripts: things that can be run in one of the usual IDE's like python's ide or node's ide, etc. Java and such is fine, too, but if you provide a jar file as an executable please also provide the text therein, as some of us can't decompile them easily to understand.

	- other stuff: documents, etc. that you might run. links to packages or tarballs to execute on the existing software. links to gists describing experiences that are useful. there's a wiki here, maybe for searchning we use that.
